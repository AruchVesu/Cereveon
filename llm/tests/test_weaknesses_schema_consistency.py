Bidirectional schema pin for the post-game weaknesses dict.

Context
-------
PR #171 (2026-05-16) closed a silent contract drift between two
parts of the SECA pipeline:

  PRODUCER: ``compute_accuracy_from_pgn`` writes the player's weakness
            vector into ``event.weaknesses_json`` after the game ends.
            Pre-PR-#171 it used SEVERITY keys:
                {"blunders": 0.2, "mistakes": 0.1, "inaccuracies": 0.0}

  CONSUMER: ``aggregate_from_weakness_dicts`` reads the vector back to
            compute ``MistakeStats.dominant_category`` for the
            curriculum recommender and the PostGameCoachController's
            Rule 5.  It expects PHASE keys:
                {"opening": 0.12, "middlegame": 0.05, "endgame": 0.00}
            ... mapped through ``_PHASE_TO_CATEGORIES`` to category
            scores.  Severity keys silently produced empty
            ``phase_rates`` -> empty ``category_scores`` ->
            ``dominant_category=None`` for every player.

Effect: the multi-game probe on 2026-05-16 showed dominant_category
stuck at None after 5 hand-shaped games covering tactics-heavy /
endgame-heavy / draw / win profiles.  Curriculum stuck on the
fallback "mistakes" topic and PostGameCoachController fell through
every rule to "No trigger" because Rule 5 needs recent_weaknesses
populated.

This file pins the producer-consumer contract in BOTH directions so
neither side can drift without immediately breaking CI.

Pinned invariants
-----------------
 1. PRODUCER_KEYS_ARE_PHASE_SUBSET
        ``compute_accuracy_from_pgn`` -> ``AccuracyAnalysis.weaknesses``
        keys are a subset of {"opening", "middlegame", "endgame"}
        across a representative spread of game shapes.

 2. PRODUCER_VALUES_ARE_RATES_IN_UNIT_INTERVAL
        Every value in the dict is in [0.0, 1.0] (rate over total
        player moves).

 3. CONSUMER_ROUNDTRIP_PRODUCES_DOMINANT_CATEGORY
        Producer output -> JSON -> ``aggregate_from_weakness_dicts``
        produces a non-None ``dominant_category`` for a game that
        had at least one player mistake or blunder.

 4. PHASE_CLASSIFIER_MATCHES_HISTORICAL_PRODUCER
        ``pgn_accuracy._phase`` agrees with
        ``analysis.analyzer.GameWeaknessAnalyzer._phase`` on the
        piece-count thresholds.  Both producers must agree or
        downstream aggregation drifts again.

 5. EMPTY_GAME_DOES_NOT_LEAK_KEYS
        A clean game with no player mistakes (or zero moves
        analysed) emits an empty dict, not a dict of zero-rate keys.
        Keeps event.weaknesses_json compact.
