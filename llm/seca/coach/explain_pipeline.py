    """Single-shot LLM completion against DeepSeek's chat-completions API.

    The Mode-2 prompt that arrives here is already a fully-rendered
    string (system + style + RAG + history + user query, assembled by
    ``render_mode_2_prompt``).  Rather than re-architect the prompt
    layer to use OpenAI-style multi-turn ``messages``, we wrap the
    rendered prompt as a single user message — the model receives the
    same content it would have received via Ollama's ``/api/generate``,
    just over a different wire format.

    Returns the assistant's reply text, stripped.  Raises:
      - ``LLMConfigError`` when ``COACH_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`` is unset.
      - ``httpx.HTTPStatusError`` on non-2xx (caught upstream by the
        retry loop in ``generate_validated_explanation`` and the
        deterministic-fallback path in chat_pipeline / live_move).
      - ``httpx.HTTPError`` on empty / malformed streaming responses.

    Architecture: this function is the LLM Layer's only outbound
    point per ``docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`` ("LLM Generation
    (untrusted)").  Output validators downstream (Mode-2 negative,
    output firewall, ESV grounding) are unaffected by the provider
    swap — they validate the returned text regardless of where it
    came from.

    Wire format: as of 2026-05-14 (PR 8) the request uses
    ``stream: True`` and consumes DeepSeek's SSE response server-side
    rather than waiting for the full response in one shot.  Two
    benefits:

    - The HTTP connection to DeepSeek receives bytes continuously
      throughout generation — middleboxes / reverse proxies are less
      likely to close it as idle.
    - Server-side time-to-finish improves slightly on long responses
      because we process tokens as they arrive instead of waiting for
      the model to finalise the full body.

    The return type and downstream contract are unchanged: callers
    receive the full assembled string only after the stream ends.  The
    architecture's "validators run on full output before bytes reach
    the client" invariant is preserved end-to-end — see
    ``docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`` "Output Validation".  True token-level
    streaming to the client is intentionally not done here; see the
    PR 8 description for the architecture-trade-off discussion.
